# Test Plan and Evidence / Results of Testing

## Game Description

The project involves the programming of a two-player game.

The game is about chance and strategy. You and another player both start with 10 explorers. 
With a goal of getting 20 explorers and 200 gold.
For the main quest the users will pick a number (either 1 or 2), 
then the computer picks a random number from these two numbers.
If the user guesses right, then they will be rewarded 10 gold. 
If they guess wrong they there will be a 50/50 chance they lose an explorer.
There will also be random hard challenges, that could offer high reward but higher risk as well. 
One of these hard challenges will consist of the user picking 1 number out of 3. 
If they user gets it right, they gain 3 explorers and 30 gold, but if they get wrong then they would lose for example, 1 explorer and 20 gold.

The strategy of this game is that you could bet against the opposite player when it is their turn.
This will be done by you picking a different number that the opposition did not choose, 
meaning that if the opposition gets their number wrong and the user got it right while betting against them, 
the user gets the reward and the opposition loses the set amount, and vice versa.
